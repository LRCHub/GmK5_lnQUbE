Where it began,
I can't begin to knowing
But then I know it's growing strong
Wasn't the spring, oh oh oh oh
And spring became the summer

Who'd believe you'd come along
Hands, touching hands, reaching out
Touching me, touching you
Sweet Caroline oh oh oh oh
Good times never seem so good so good so good so good

I've been inclined oh oh oh oh
To believe it never would
But now I
I look at the night oh oh oh oh
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two

And when I hurt oh oh oh oh
Hurting runs off my shoulder
How can I hurt when holding you
One
Touching one

Reaching out

Touching me
Touching you
Sweet Caroline oh oh oh oh
Good times never seem so good so good so good so good
I've been inclined to believe it never would
Sweet Caroline oh oh oh oh
Good times never seem so good so good so good so good
Sweet Caroline oh oh oh oh
I've been inclined to believe it never could no no no no
Sweet Caroline oh oh oh oh
Good times never seem so good so good so good so good
Sweet Caroline
